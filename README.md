Low health indicator for Minecraft

This is a Fabric mod written for Minecraft. It gives you an audible cue that your health is low. Feel free to submit requested features as an issue!

### Current low health alarms:

- Heartbeat - Uses vanilla noteblock sounds to play a heartbeat-like sound; optionally set it to play faster as your health gets low
- Custom Sound - Specify a sound of your choice; anything that you can play with `/playsound` will work. You can set the volume, pitch, and speed for both low and critical health.

Low health alarms can be set separately for yourself and other players.
